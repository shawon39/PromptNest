# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tools like:
- Canva
- GIMP
- Photoshop
- Online SVG to PNG converters

## Recommended Design

The icons should feature:
- A document/list icon representing prompts
- Blue color scheme (#3B82F6) to match the UI
- Simple, clean design that works at small sizes
- White or light-colored elements on the blue background

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use any 16px, 48px, and 128px PNG files named appropriately. The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use default ones), but custom icons provide better branding.
